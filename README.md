## Canine Separation Anxiety & The Pandemic Puppy
Current trends show a huge increase in dog ownership as a result of the change in lifestyle caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. With this increase in dog ownership, along with the prospect of a return to work and subsequently a significant change to the routine of the “pandemic puppy”, there is widespread concern that there will be a rise in the occurrence of separation anxiety in dogs. This concern is shared widely by owners of dogs who face a return to the workplace.

When left alone, dogs can often resort to destructive behaviours - either as a result of separation anxiety, or just plain boredom - in an effort to find the mental and physical stimulation they require.

This often results in financial and emotional hardship on dog owners, and in extreme cases can lead to the dog being relinquished, or even euthanised.

## Solution

paw.pad is an interactive platform that connects owner and dog remotely in a fun, exciting and stimulating way. The product features four touch-pads - if the dog hits the illuminated pad, it receives a food reward. The paw.pad mobile app allows owners to play and interact with their dogs in real time. Various games and challenges are also programmed into the paw.pad such that dogs can play and learn by themselves. The paw.pad provides a fun and safe source of mental stimulation, keeping your dog busy and out of trouble throughout the day.

## Code and Electronics

The working prototype uses 4x 24-bit NeoPixel LED rings powered by a 12V supply and controlled with an Arduino MEGA. The C++ program randomly illuminates an LED ring and detects when the user (dog) hits a 'pad' by measuring the input signal received from the piezo sensor under each pad. Upon a successful hit, a solenoid is activated which shoots a dog treat from the front of the housing.
